        Lumbini is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the birthplace of Lord Buddha, located in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Buddhists around the world. 
        The Maya Devi Temple, which marks the spot of Buddha's birth, is at the heart of Lumbini. The site is also home to the Ashoka Pillar, built by Emperor Ashoka in 249 BC, and numerous monasteries built by Buddhist communities from various countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lumbini Garden is a peaceful space where visitors can meditate and reflect on the life and teachings of Buddha. The World Peace Pagoda offers breathtaking views of the surrounding area and is a symbol of global peace.
      </p>
